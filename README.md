# Neural Networks

In this project, I implement and optimise neural network models for different regression and classiffication tasks. 

This project is split into 3 parts:
* Part 1: Creating a neural network mini-library. I have created a low-level implementation of a multi-layered neural network, including a basic implementation of the
backpropagation algorithm. 
* Part 2: Create and train a neural network for classication. I have used the mini-library I have developed and the PyTorch neural network library to solve a classication task in insurance pricing.
* Part 3: Participate in a simulated insurance market. I have created an insurance pricing model trained on real data to compete with other algorithms. 

The mini-library in Part 1 is designed using NumPy.

For the models in Parts 2 and 3 I have used the PyTorch neural network library and mini-library developed in the first part.
